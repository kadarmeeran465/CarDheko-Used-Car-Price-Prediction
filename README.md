## Approach üîç

1. **Data Processing**:
   - **Concatenation**: Import and merge datasets from various cities into a unified format.
   - **Missing Value Treatment**: Handle missing values with imputation or by creating new categories.
   - **Data Standardization**: Ensure consistent formatting (e.g., converting "70 kms" to numerical).
   - **Categorical Encoding**: Apply One-Hot or Label Encoding for categorical variables.
   - **Feature Scaling**: Normalize numerical features as required.
   - **Outlier Removal**: Remove or cap outliers to maintain data quality.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarize key statistics for each variable.
   - **Data Visualization**: Use plots (scatter, box, histogram, etc.) to uncover trends.
   - **Feature Selection**: Identify influential features impacting price prediction.

3. **Model Development**:
   - **Train-Test Split**: Separate data into training and testing sets.
   - **Model Selection**: Choose suitable algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting.
   - **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize model parameters for best performance.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Use evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared to assess model accuracy.

5. **Optimization**:
   - **Feature Engineering**: Create or refine features for enhanced prediction accuracy.
   - **Regularization**: Apply Lasso or Ridge to prevent model overfitting.

6. **Deployment**:
   - **Streamlit Application**: Build and deploy an interactive web app with user input options for real-time predictions.
   - **User Interface Design**: Ensure an intuitive, easy-to-navigate app layout.
